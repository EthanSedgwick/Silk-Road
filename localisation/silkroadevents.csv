EVTDESC19690007;We are known as the ßYYellow Tigerß!. For millenia this subcontinent has been divided between squabbling tribes and over ambitious fools - yet it is we who stands as Kings in the North.\n\nWith our people's secured it is time to look south. Central India is open for the taking. The merchant kings already fear our strength and will soon bow should we demonstrate it for them. However we are not the only nation who dreams of empire... To the south, the Red Tiger of Travancore has recently united the South and to the East the White Tiger of Bengal have assimilated the Burmese. While their people would never accept us as Kings, the Kanauji merchants are a weak people who will bend the knee to whoever is the strongest... And so we must be the ones to show them what Empire truly means.\n\nùgAs an Indian major, you are able to participate in the Race for Central India. In order to win you must hold more Central Indian capitals than your rivals for 10 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC69199800;Glory to the Emperor! ßROur puppet king.ß!\n It was the Military Junta that has guided this country to new heights and it will be the Military Junta that completes our conquests. Through military might we have carved through the Koreans and the Faren, to the point the Korean state has now dissolved. Like lame dogs the Faren begged us for a ceasefire and in our mercy, we have granted it. They do not need to know how thin our own supply lines were...  Unfortunately our enemies have used this time well, as it seems they have convinced the thoughtless Manchurians to join their side. The horde looks poised to strike for the rich Iron and Coal mines of Korea, the core of our industrial heart\n\n It is clear then that our time is limited. The Junta must use this time to consolidate control, build up defenses and prepare for battle. \nWar is coming. ßRWe will be ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
